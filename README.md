# Bayesian Cognitive Modeling in Pymc3
Pymc3 codes of Lee and Wagenmakers' Bayesian Cognitive Modeling - A Pratical Course

I am working through Lee and Wagenmakers' Bayesian Cognitive Modeling - A Pratical Course. Most of the models are written in pymc3 (except some early examples are in pymc2). All the codes are in jupyter notebook with the model explain in distributions.
  
# Notice: 
[Pymc3](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3/) is currently still under development. I wrote and tested the code base on the Pymc3 release at the early 2016 - I will try to keep it up-to-date of the newest release of Pymc3
