# Statistical Rethinking with Python and PyMC3

[Statistical Rethinking](http://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/) is an incredible good introductory book to Bayesian Statistics, its follows a _Jaynesian_ and practical approach with very good examples and clear explanations.

In this repository I am (slowly) porting the examples in the book to PyMC3. I am trying to keep the examples as close as possible to those in the book, while at the same time I am trying to express them in the most _Pythonic_ and _PyMC3onic_ way I can. 

All contributions are wellcome!
