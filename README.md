# Bayesian Cognitive Modeling in PyMC3
PyMC3 port of Lee and Wagenmakers' [Bayesian Cognitive Modeling - A Pratical Course](http://bayesmodels.com)

All the codes are in jupyter notebook with the model explain in distributions (as in the book).
  
# Notice: 
[PyMC3](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3/) is currently still under development. This repository is tested under PyMC3v3.1.rc2

# To do:
- Two models in Chapter 18 (18.3 and 18.4) still need some optimization. Currently the traces show poor mixing.
- The model in Chapter 19 is incomplete.
