# Statistical Rethinking with Python and PyMC3

[Statistical Rethinking](http://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/) is an incredible good introductory book to Bayesian Statistics, its follows a _Jaynesian_ and practical approach with very good examples and clear explanations.

In this repository we are (slowly) porting the examples in the book to PyMC3. We are trying to keep the examples as close as possible to those in the book, while at the same time we are trying to express them in the most _Pythonic_ and _PyMC3onic_ way we can. 

All contributions are welcome!

Chapter 1-4 are already ported. Feel free to send PR to fix errors, improve the code or made comments that could help the user of this repository and readers of the book.

If you want to contribute with an entire chapter or a big section. Please check the issues track to see which chapters are not assigned yet and need contributors.
