# Bayesian Cognitive Modeling in Pymc3
Pymc3 codes of Lee and Wagenmakers' Bayesian Cognitive Modeling - A Pratical Course

I am working through Lee and Wagenmakers' Bayesian Cognitive Modeling - A Pratical Course. Most of the models are written in pymc3 (except some early examples are in pymc2). All the codes are in jupyter notebook with the model explain in distributions.
